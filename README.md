<h1 align="center">👋 Greetings! I'm Taylan Öztürk</h1>
<h3 align="center">💻 Programmer | 🧠 Chess Player | 👊 Martial Arts Enthusiast</h3>

I'm a full-stack web developer and a programmer developing CLIs, web apps, and desktop applications. I primarily work with Python and JavaScript, but I genuinely relish the power and expressiveness of Rust 🦀, especially when it comes to embracing declarative programming principles. It's also my favourite programming language at the same time. 

As an advocate of free software and open-source projects, I try to spread FOSS philosophy among people and convince them exploring the Linux universe. 

I'm also into keen interest on martial arts, learning spoken languages and video games. I used to be a beast in competitive pvp minigames in Minecraft 🏹

All aside, I remarkably have a true passion and love for [chess](https://lichess.org/@/DrShahinstein) considering the profound beautiful philosophy of it.

I'm open to networking and connecting with fellow developers and enthusiasts. Let's collaborate on exciting projects and gather same minds together!
